- **Midjourney:** Excellent pentru artistic technical illustrations, vibrant colors
- **Stable Diffusion:** Customizable, good pentru specific style requirements
- **Adobe Firefly:** Professional results, good color control

### Post-Processing

După generare, consideră:

1. Crop și resize la dimensiuni standard
